## Objectives:
In this lab, you will explore abstraction and sequential programming through Snap!. By the end of the lab, you will:
- Learn Pair Programming
- Familiarize yourself with the Snap! interface
- Make a Snap! account to save and load projects
- Learn to use the mouse to move sprites around the screen
- Make a Kaleidoscope

For this lab it is highly reccomended you go through the [workbook](https://cs10.org/bjc-r/llab/html/topic.html?1&2&3&topic=berkeley_bjc%2Fintro_pair%2F1-introduction.topic&course&novideo&noreading&noassignment). It presents a step by step guide on getting started on Snap!.

## Required Sections

### Introduction to Snap!
- Objectives:
    - Run Snap! and create a Snap! account on your device.
    - Investigate Snap!'s user interface. Explore and identitfy different portions of the program.
    - Create programs that allow the user to control and move your sprite around the stage.
      
### [Make A Kaleidoscope](https://cs10.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/intro/drawing/kaleidoscope-small.html?1&2&3&topic=berkeley_bjc%2Fintro_pair%2F1-introduction.topic&course&novideo&noreading&noassignment)
- Objectives:
    - Explore [this drawing program](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#open:https://cs10.org/bjc-r/prog/drawing/kaleidoscope_framework.xml) and identify effects of the script on each of the sprites.
    - Combine blocks to create a script that will follow your cursor while making reflective and symmetrics drawings simultaneously like a kaleidoscope (see below).
    - Look at the steps and tips found on this [workbook page](https://cs10.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/intro/drawing/kaleidoscope-small.html?1&1&1&2&2&2&3&3&3&topic=berkeley_bjc%2Fintro_pair%2F1-introduction.topic&course&novideo&noreading&noassignment)!
