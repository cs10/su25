Hey there! I'm Jaclyn, a sophomore studying Data Science, and I'm so excited to be part of the CS10 team! I came to Cal with zero coding experience and I'm always happy to chat or help out, so don’t hesitate to reach out! In my free time, you’ll probably find me doing escape rooms or hunting down new boba spots. :))
