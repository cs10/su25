Hi there! My name is Hitha and I'm a freshman studying Computer Science and Data Science. Some of the classes I have taken/taking that have given me the technical experience to intern for CS10 include: Data8, CS61A, Stat 33a, and Econ148. Feel free to ask me about these classes or anything in general! I'm super excited to have a pedagogical perspective on my major and I can't wait to assist with labs, OH, and projects. Outside of the classroom I love to hike, paddleboard, workout, and enjoy the fresh air. I'm always open to chat :D
