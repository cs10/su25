Hey everyone! I'm super excited to teach CS10 this summer. I've taught various computer science and data science classes at Berkeley and Caltech. I'm generally interested in how we make ethics education accessible and engaging to a technical audience. Outside of teaching, I love playing volleyball, TFT, and wandering around the city (Berkeley is beautiful)! Reach out if you ever need anything.
