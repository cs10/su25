Hello there! My name is Edan and I'm a sophomore studying EECS. I am excited to be an AI for CS10 this spring for my first semester on course staff! Outside of school I enjoy playing soccer and basketball, skiing, hiking, poker, and watching sports. Feel free to ask me questions about the course or anything else!
