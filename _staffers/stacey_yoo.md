Hello! I'm Stacey, a senior majoring in bioengineering. I took CS10 in Spring 2022 and have been involved with the team ever since. I'm thrilled to be returning as a TA this Summer. CS10 was a great, friendly introduction to computer science at Berkeley, and it really helped me dive into the field with confidence. Outside of the classroom, I enjoy cooking, listening to music, and being creative. Feel free to reach out with any questions! :D
