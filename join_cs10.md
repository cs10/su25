# Joining CS 10 Late â€“ What You Need to Know

### Can I still catch up?  
**Yes!** With effort, you can get up to speed.

### What should I do first?  
Start from the beginningâ€”go through the [syllabus](https://cs10.org/su25/syllabus/), lectures, and assignments in order. A handy tracker will be available once you join the class. The class schedule can be found on our [home page](https://cs10.org/su25/). You should also fill out this [Late Add form](https://forms.gle/8PBLagkfg8whcgHb6) to make sure you get added to all of our necessary platforms. 

### Will I be penalized for missed work?  
**No**, you wonâ€™t be penalized for assignments due before you joined. Lecture attendance for past lectures will be waived. 

### Will deadlines be adjusted for me?  
**Yes**, assignments based on the week you join and past work will be adjusted. A deadline tracker with adjusted due dates can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ENbFHOisGip_hzquSr_7_7K77gQBMGSBJGbZOncNX4/edit?usp=sharing). Note you must be logged into your UC Berkeley account. 

### Do I still need to take the first exam?  
**Yes**, all students are required to take the first exam: Quiz 1. Other exam policies can be found in our [syllabus](https://cs10.org/su25/syllabus/#exams)!

### How much time will it take to catch up?  
It depends, but expect to spend extra hours at first. Attend OH or Support OH for more catered help. 

### Can I get extra help?  
**Yes!** Our Regular and Support OH times can be found on this [calendar](https://cs10.org/su25/calendar/).

Stay focused, reach out for support **cs10@berkeley.edu**, and youâ€™ll catch up in no time! ðŸš€
