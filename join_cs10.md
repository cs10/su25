# Joining CS 10 Late – What You Need to Know

### Can I still catch up?  
**Yes!** With effort, you can get up to speed.

### What should I do first?  
Start from the beginning—go through the syllabus, lectures, and assignments in order. A handy tracker will be available once you join the class. The class schedule can be found on our [home page](https://cs10.org/sp25/).

### Will I be penalized for missed work?  
**No**, you won’t be penalized for assignments due before you joined.

### Will deadlines be adjusted for me?  
**Yes**, assignments based on the week you join and past work will be adjusted.

### Do I still need to take the first exam?  
**Yes**, all students are required to take the first exam: **Quest**. Other exam policies can be found in our [syllabus](https://cs10.org/sp25/syllabus/#exams)!

### How much time will it take to catch up?  
It depends, but expect to spend extra hours at first.

### Can I get extra help?  
**Yes!** Our Regular and Support OH times can be found on this [calendar](https://cs10.org/sp25/calendar/).
