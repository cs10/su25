# Resolving Your Incomplete / Continuing Work Grade

This page outlines the logistics of resolving your grade and includes key next steps, policies, and the forms you need to complete.

---

## What should I do first?

You’ll need to be manually enrolled into course platforms like **bCourses, Gradescope, PrairieLearn**, and **EdStem**.  

To get started, please enroll yourself in our [EdStem forum](https://edstem.org/us/join/MZFuQN) and complete the [Incomplete Summer 2025 Registration Form](https://forms.gle/eqk8AQuTk55r8nyz8).  
**Completing this form is required** in order to resolve your incomplete this summer.

We’re here to support you — once you fill out the form, we’ll work with you to clarify what you need to finish and grant access to past specs / instructions. 

---

## Who should I contact if I have questions?

Your main point of contact for the summer is **Stacey Yoo**.  
The best ways to reach staff are:
- Posting on **EdStem**
- Attending **Support Office Hours** (listed on the [calendar](https://cs10.org/su25/calendar/))

For questions specific to incompletes, you can also email **cs10@berkeley.edu**, but response times will be slower by email.

## How can I get a list of assignments I need to complete?

If this is your first time resolving an incomplete, please complete the [Incomplete Summer 2025 Registration Form](https://forms.gle/eqk8AQuTk55r8nyz8) with as much information as possible.

After that, you can:
- Make a post on EdStem  
- Visit Stacey's office hours (messaging ahead of time will be useful) 

We will review your current grade and let you know which assignments are still missing or incomplete. After that, you’ll be given access to a folder containing the relevant past assignment specifications and instructions.

---

## How do I submit work or assignments?

To ensure your submissions are counted, follow these steps:

- **Gradescope**: Use the *CS10 Summer 2025 Gradescope instance* to submit:
  - Projects 1–4 and Final Project  
  - Reading Quizzes and Lecture Quizzes (by request) 
  - Labs  
  - Coding portions of exams (if applicable) 

- **PrairieLearn**: Use the *CS10 Summer 2025 PrairieLearn instance* to complete:
  - Pyturis (if applicable)

- **Exams**: All exams will be taken **in person** this semester. Dates are listed on the [syllabus](https://cs10.org/su25/syllabus/#exams).  
  - Quiz 1 = Quest  
  - Quiz 2 = Midterm  
  - Quiz 3 = Postterm  
  - ❗ *Incomplete students may not take second-chance quizzes*

- **Google Form**: You must also submit **each assignment** using this [Incomplete Submission Form]() so we can update your gradebook.  
  Please fill out the form **every time** you submit or resubmit an assignment.  
  After an exam, use the same form to confirm completion.

> ⚠ **Important Notes**  
> - Only submit the assignments that were required during your *original* semester of CS10.  
> - Labs, projects, and quizzes may be **renumbered** or changed. Use `cs10.org/(your semester)` to check the correct versions.  
> - Submit a **separate Google Form** for **each** assignment.

## How can I take an exam?

All exams this summer are:
- **In person**
- **On paper**

As an Incomplete or Continuing Work student, you may only take the **first offering** of each exam:
- Quiz 1 (Quest)  
- Quiz 2 (Midterm)  
- Quiz 3 (Postterm)

You are **not eligible** for retake or second-chance exams.

Check the [syllabus](https://cs10.org/su25/syllabus/#exams) for dates.  
If you have an emergency or need to request an alternate exam time, please contact us **before** the exam.

## Requesting an Extension for an Incomplete Grade

If you need more time beyond the default Incomplete deadline, you’ll need to file an **Incomplete Grade Extension Petition**.  

You should begin this process **at least 30 days before** the current deadline.  
Only your instructor can submit the final form to your college.

> 🔒 **Important:**  
> - Only fill out the **student section** of the form  
> - Leave the instructor signature and resolution date **blank**  
> - Upload your filled form to **EdStem**, and we will complete and submit it

📄 [Incomplete Grade Extension Form (PDF)](https://registrar.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/updated_Fillable_All-College-Petition-to-Extend-Incomplete-Form-11.23-Google-Docs.pdf)  
Unfortunately, we don’t have access to your Incomplete deadline. You can view it on **CalCentral** under the semester when you originally enrolled in CS10.

## What if my Incomplete grade has already lapsed to an 'F'?

If your grade has lapsed, we are **not able** to change it ourselves.

Please speak with your **college advisor** to discuss your options.  
Note that reversal is not guaranteed.

If your grade lapsed due to a **staff error** (e.g., we didn’t submit a form in time), contact us on **EdStem immediately** so we can investigate.

---

## Receiving Your Final Grade

If you’ve completed all requirements and are ready for your final grade to be posted:

- Please contact us on **EdStem**  
- We will confirm your current grade and resolve it in **CalCentral**

⚠ Grades can only be changed **once**, so make sure you’re satisfied before finalizing.

---

## For Continuing Work Students

The process for Continuing Work students is **nearly identical** to resolving an Incomplete.

The only key difference is:
- You **do not** need to request an Incomplete Extension

Please follow all other instructions in this guide.
