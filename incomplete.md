# Resolving your Incomplete / Continuing Work Grade

Here you will find logistics about resolving your grade, along with next steps and the forms needed to submit.

## What should I do first?

You will need to be manually enrolled into each of the platforms (Bcourses, Gradescope, PrairieLearn, EdStem). To get started, please enroll yourself into the [EdStem](https://edstem.org/us/join/HfmcD2) and make a post about being enrolled into the platforms.

## Who should I contact if I have questions?

Your main point of contact will be Victoria Phelps. I can be contacted through EdStem or through my office hours, which are on the calendar. You may also email me, but I will be slower to respond through email. 

## How can I get a list of assignment that I need to complete?

Please make an EdStem post or come to Victoria's office hours to get the list of assignments. I will let you know what your current grade is and which assignments do not have full credit.

## How do I submit work / assignments?

To submit projects 1-3, 4, and the final project, Reading Quizzes, Lecture quizzes, coding portions to exams, and Labs, students will use the current Gradescope instance. To submit Pyturis and complete exams, you will use the current PrairieLearn instance. You will ALSO need to submit ALL assignments to this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/fd71vCa76GwECacB6), to let us know to update the assignment in our gradebook

After taking exams, students will indicate completion of exams on this form. 

Not all assignments will be applicable to you. You only need to submit the assignments that were required during your ORIGINAL semester of taking CS10. Note, labs, projects, and lecture quizzes might be numbered differently than when you originally took the class. Some projects have also changed or have been removed, so please consult the cs10.org/(semester you took cs10) to ensure you are completing the correct assignments.

Please submit this form, FOR EACH assignment you resubmit.

## How can I take an exam?

All exams are released through PrairieLearn. Incomplete and Continuing Work students are only eligible to complete the first exams that are released in a semester (Quest 1, Midterm 1, and Postterm 1). You would not be eligible to take any of the retake exams. Keep an eye out for when these exams are released, so you do not miss the opportunity to take it.

## Request an Extension for an Incomplete Grade

You should plan to do this at least 30 days prior to the instructor's deadline to submit this petition. Your instructor will then need to submit the signed Incomplete Extension form to the colleged you are enrolled. The instructor will need to sign part of the form (including the signature, current date, and date to resolve incomplete), so do not fill out those portions yourself! Only fill out the portions with your pertinent student information and the assignments needed to resolve. 

The form can be found here: [Incomplete Grade Extension Form](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://registrar.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/updated_Fillable_All-College-Petition-to-Extend-Incomplete-Form-11.23-Google-Docs.pdf). Once you have completed your portion of the form, please upload it to EdStem, and we will fill out the rest and submit it on your behalf.

Unfortunately, we do not have access to when your Incomplete grade expires. However, you should be able to view this on CalCentral under the semester that you originally took CS10. 

## What to do if your Incomplete grade has lapsed to an 'F'

Unfortunately, we are not able to change the grade after this point. You would need to speak with your college advisor, but there is no guarantee they would be able to change it. 

If your grade lapsed to an 'F' because we did not file the correct form, or there was an administrative error, please reach out on EdStem ASAP. 

## Resolving Grade / Receiving Final Letter Grade

If you are ready to receive your final letter grade, please reach out on EdStem. Note, we are only able to change your grade once, so please ensure that you know what the current grade is and are satisfied to move forward with it being resovled on CalCentral.

## Continuing Work Students

Much of the process is the same as resolving an Incomplete. The other difference is that you do not need to request an Extension. Please follow all other steps though.
