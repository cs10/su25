## Introduction

For your final project, you'll be turning in both code and a README. The README, which is a document that describes your project and its features, is meant to be an assignment where you'll write up documentation to practice explaining your work to someone else. This project is a chance for you to implement an idea driven by your own interest!


## Technical Requirements

There are certain technical and style requirements that we want you to be able to demonstrate in the implementation of your final project, regardless of what kind of project you're doing, which are listed below. For some of the rubric items, you can also mix and match (see rubric for more details). Here is a list of some of the technical requirements you must include:

- Non-trivial list: Your project should include at least one non-trivial list, meaning a list whose function could not be simply replaced with another implementation. Often this can be a tracker of high scores, or part of a game board.
- Custom block/function: Your project should include at least TWO functions that you define yourself. There is no restriction on what type of function this should be, whatever suits your project is what you should do!
- Script/local variable: Your project should include at least one non-global variable. 


## Style Requirements

It’s best to keep up good style (commenting, specific variable names, non-repetitive code) as you work your way through implementing a project, but that doesn’t always happen. This is a list of what style markers you should aim for as you’re coding, but we also recommend that you do a final sweep for these before you submit!
- **Commenting** -- At minimum, we’re looking for clear and coherent comments for the following purposes:
    - Describing how to start/run the program: Often, this is the green flag for Snap!, and typing a command into the terminal for Python. Make sure to specify what to do, even if it seems obvious! The tutors are not as familiar with your project as you are. Make sure this is in both your code as a comment and in your README file. 
    - For each function or block you’ve written: An explanation of its inputs + its outputs or what data it changes if it’s a command block or does not return anything.
    - Here’s a [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vSrtiqOPprVJ327uvCj9aRGXJYGP9hjOMJyz_vSxK237PNnTCYumvE24QYcbmA_Xy8voUPOqHzXtZOO/pub?embedded=true) to commenting for reference!
- **Variables & functions**
    - Variable scope: Make sure you’re only using global variables when absolutely necessary (i.e., when they need to be referenced at multiple points in the program, or by multiple functions). Try to use script/local variables where possible. 
    - Naming convention: Keep function and variable names clear, by specifying what they do or represent. A good rule of thumb is to give things names in a way that would still make sense to you if you needed to explain this project to someone else in a year. For example, a variable could be called “highScore” if it keeps track of the highest score so far. 
- **Abstraction & generalization** — These are key computing ideas for a reason! Do your best to apply these principles as you code. Often, this will look like one of the following:
    - Generalizing code: If you can use a for-loop or a HOF or a helper function to prevent copy-pasting similar code, do it!
    - Levels of abstraction: Do your best to break down functions or features into smaller, concise pieces, so that each function can be focused on achieving a specific task or subtask. 
        - If you find yourself with repetitive code, consider how you can abstract the part that is repeated. 



## README Requirements

Your README is meant to serve as a guide to your project, and will be used by the readers as a reference for grading to ensure that you’ve achieved all of the requirements. Instructions for the general sections of the README are included in the template. An additional optional section, the Bug Writeup, is explained in detail below.

The template (including instructions) for the final project README can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GiZ6tE-mnezyiry7p_gmEswNRfx7ntNjT3Z-wcfZToA/edit?tab=t.0). Please make a copy of the Google Doc to work on, and make sure to submit it as a **PDF**. 

**[Optional] Bug Writeup**: Sometimes, despite your best efforts, the project deadline rolls around and you’ve still got a bug big enough that one or more of your features isn’t working correctly. This happens in industry as well — think about app updates you’ve downloaded! 

Not to fret, you can earn back up to 75% of the points originally lost for a non-functional feature with a thorough write-up. (Points given will depend on the size of the bug; this is meant to limit the points penalty for not implementing a bug-free project feature.) 

Here’s an [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A6Tzm0UZte8gMnnmE2PV1J9xO__z6SaLkDVA6j3-I5s/edit?tab=t.0) of what we’re looking for in a bug writeup, based on a function you wrote for the OOP lab.


## Video Requirements
Your video is meant to be a supplement to your README, and will be used to make sure that your submission is graded fairly. Please demonstrate exactly how to run your project (especially if you are using Python), the controls, and each of the features. If you are completing a Bug write-up, please demonstrate the bug(s) that you are explaining in your README in order to receive points back. Your video must be under 3 minutes in order to receive full credit.

You may either submit your video via Google Drive or YouTube. If you are submitting through YouTube please create an unlisted video. The Teaching Assistants will not be grading the projects. If you are submitting through Google Drive please make sure to share your video with the Tutors from the course website. 

*Additionally, include the link to your shared video in your README. If we do not have access to your video you may not get credit for this portion of the assignment.*

## Submission Guidelines

You should submit two things to the Gradescope final project assignment:
- **README**: This should be written on a copy of the template above with an embedded link to your video, and be submitted as a PDF. We will not accept READMEs submitted as .docx files or Drive links, etc.
- **Project code**: This will be either a .xml file or a .zip folder. Your instructions will vary depending on what language your project is in.

*Snap! projects*: 
- Download the .xml file from Snap!, using File > Export Project.
- Rename the file to FirstPartner_SecondPartner_FinalProject.xml and upload directly to Gradescope. (Adjust accordingly if you are working solo or in a group of three.)
- Upload the README PDF and the .xml file to the Final Project assignment on Gradescope.

*Python projects*:
- Put the .py file(s) containing your project code along with any other media (images, sounds, etc.) that are used in the project into a ZIP folder.
- Rename the ZIP folder FirstPartner_SecondPartner_FinalProject.zip and upload the ZIP file to Gradescope. 
- Upload the README PDF and the .zip file to the Final Project assignment on Gradescope.  (Feel free to Google "How to make a .zip file" / ask for help on Ed.)

**If you run into any issues submitting, go to a lab or office hours or make a private post on Ed**
 
## Rubric & Grading

Your project will be graded for style and technical correctness according to the following rubric. After you get your grades back, you can submit regrade requests via Gradescope (if you feel we missed something in your original file submission).  

Please don't forget to add your partner(s) to the submissions! [How to add a partner to Gradescope.](/su25/assets/images/p6/p6-1.png)
