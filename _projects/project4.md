## Introduction

This semester, you have explored how computer science and technological innovations shape society—from individual experiences to global transformations. For this project, you'll step away from coding to select a creative media format that allows you to critically examine an intersection between technology and society. The project will consist of three parts: creation of an artifact with project documentation, live presentation, and peer reflection. This approach offers an opportunity to engage with the actions and consequences of technology in a non-traditional format.

You will select a creative medium to explore a tech-related topic of your choice. Acceptable formats include art/drawings, sculptures, videos, infographics, short films or sketches (stop motion, live action, or digital using Snap! only), collages, or dioramas. Written works like essays, songs, or poems are not permitted, nor are single photographs or single-plane AI-generated content. Additional guidelines regarding AI or generative tools are written below. If you'd like to use a different medium, you must get approval from the TAs.

The medium you select should effectively convey the societal, economic, or cultural impact of your chosen topic—whether it’s a technology, theory, program, event (past or present), or object. Previous topics have included artificial intelligence (AI), Facebook, smart farming, the internet, the TikTok algorithm, robotic teachers, and online security. Examples of accepted artifacts could look like an Infographic on AI Bias in Decision-Making, a Handmade Collage on Social Media’s Impact on Youth, or a Sculpture on Data Privacy. 

If you’re unsure of a topic, consider a technological innovation that has significantly transformed the way we live, work, or interact—socially, economically, or culturally. Be sure to focus on a specific topic that allows for in-depth analysis or creative expression within the scope of the project.

We want this to be a fun and exciting project that allows you to pursue your interests. This project shouldn't feel like a grind (we are hoping!). The expected time spent on this should not exceed five hours. Ideally, most of the time spent on the project will be doing research on the topic.

## AI and Generative Tool Guidelines 

- You must create the artifact yourself. The artifact itself or documentation cannot be AI generated.
- You may only use AI tools for research, feedback, idea formation, captioning, and/or image generation to support your project.
- Plagiarism, including uncredited AI-generated work, will not be tolerated.
- All final work you submit must be your own creative work. AI should assist, but not replace, your creativity and effort.
- Any content generated by AI must be properly cited and referenced in your project.
- Citations for AI-generated content should follow the MLA format, with clear acknowledgment of the tool and its contribution.
- Be transparent about how AI tools influenced your process in the project documentation portion.

### Content

Your artifact should include details that express your technical topic in a creative and novel way.  To help you do so, your artifact should answer some (but need not answer all) of the following questions, but you must select two questions to answer from each category (define the purpose, positive and negative impacts, and technical elements):

- DEFINE THE PURPOSE:
    - What is the innovation you are focusing on? 
    - What is the context for the innovation? 
    - What social issue was this innovation meant to address? 
    - Does it resolve problems of a certain kind in a particular community? 
    - How does the innovation impact quality of life? 
    - What motivated the creation or development of the innovation?
- POSITIVE & NEGATIVE IMPACTS: 
    - What has happened as a result of this innovation, intentional or unintentional? 
    - Are there any long-term or short-term concerns for this innovation? 
    - What major impact(s) has it contributed to in society, economics, or a particular culture or subculture?
    - What kind of regulations are in place for the technology, and how do these regulations (or lack of regulations) affect the public and society?
- TECHNICAL ELEMENTS: 
    - How might we understand this innovation? 
    - How does this innovation relate to other innovations? 
    - What algorithms are involved in this innovation?
    - How is the data used and analyzed for this technology?
