## Introduction

This semester, you have explored how computer science and technological innovations shape society—from individual experiences to global transformations. For this project, you'll step away from coding to select a creative media format that allows you to critically examine an intersection between technology and society. The project will consist of three parts: creation of an artifact with project documentation, live presentation, and peer reflection. This approach offers an opportunity to engage with the actions and consequences of technology in a non-traditional format.

You will select a creative medium to explore a tech-related topic of your choice. Acceptable formats include art/drawings, sculptures, videos, infographics, short films or sketches (stop motion, live action, or digital using Snap! only), collages, or dioramas. Written works like essays, songs, or poems are not permitted, nor are single photographs or single-plane AI-generated content. Additional guidelines regarding AI or generative tools are written below. If you'd like to use a different medium, you must get approval from the TAs.

The medium you select should effectively convey the societal, economic, or cultural impact of your chosen topic—whether it’s a technology, theory, program, event (past or present), or object. Previous topics have included artificial intelligence (AI), Facebook, smart farming, the internet, the TikTok algorithm, robotic teachers, and online security. Examples of accepted artifacts could look like an Infographic on AI Bias in Decision-Making, a Handmade Collage on Social Media’s Impact on Youth, or a Sculpture on Data Privacy. 

If you’re unsure of a topic, consider a technological innovation that has significantly transformed the way we live, work, or interact—socially, economically, or culturally. Be sure to focus on a specific topic that allows for in-depth analysis or creative expression within the scope of the project.

We want this to be a fun and exciting project that allows you to pursue your interests. This project shouldn't feel like a grind (we are hoping!). The expected time spent on this should not exceed five hours. Ideally, most of the time spent on the project will be doing research on the topic.

## AI and Generative Tool Guidelines 

- You may only use AI tools for research, feedback, idea formation, captioning, and/or image generation to support your project.
- Plagiarism, including uncredited AI-generated work, will not be tolerated.
- All final work you submit must be your own creative work. AI should assist, but not replace, your creativity and effort.
- Any content generated by AI must be properly cited and referenced in your project.
- Citations for AI-generated content should follow the MLA format, with clear acknowledgment of the tool and its contribution.
- Be transparent about how AI tools influenced your process in the project documentation portion. 

## Part 1: The Artifact and Documentation

The artifact should adhere to the following guidelines:
- Solo project
- Adhere to our guidelines regarding artificial intelligence and generative tools
- Use of creative medium to explore a tech-related topic of your choice.
    - Acceptable formats include: art/drawings (digital or traditional), sculptures, collages (physical), videos, infographics, short film/sketches (stop motion, live action, or digital using Snap! only), and dioramas
    - Please note that video submissions should be no longer than 5 minutes in length
    - Banned: Essays, songs, poems, or single photographs
- Focuses on a single topic/innovation and its impacts
- Projects should be created in a manner that maximizes accessibility to all audiences (e.g., captions for videos, clear visuals, minimum 12pt font).
- Ability to be showcased (either through digital projection/download or physical presentation)
- 200-350 words reflection documentation explaining the creative process, the research behind the project, and the message you aimed to communicate
    - Minimum Word Count: 200 - 350 
    - Hard Maximum: 450 
- If applicable: include a Works Cited page using MLA format for citations (does not count towards the word count)
    - For in-text citations, reference the author and page number in parentheses, e.g., “Technology is cool” (AuthorLastName 40)
- Credit any and all images used in your project


### Content

Your artifact should include details that express your technical topic in a creative and novel way.  To help you do so, your artifact should answer some (but need not answer all) of the following questions, but you must select questions from each category (define the purpose, positive and negative impacts, and technical elements):

- DEFINE THE PURPOSE:
    - What is the innovation you are focusing on? 
    - What is the context for the innovation? 
    - What social issue was this innovation meant to address? 
    - Does it resolve problems of a certain kind in a particular community? 
    - How does the innovation impact quality of life? 
    - What motivated the creation or development of the innovation?
- POSITIVE & NEGATIVE IMPACTS: 
    - What has happened as a result of this innovation, intentional or unintentional? 
    - Are there any long-term or short-term concerns for this innovation? 
    - What major impact(s) has it contributed to in society, economics, or a particular culture or subculture?
- TECHNICAL ELEMENTS: 
    - How might we understand this innovation? 
    - How does this innovation relate to other innovations? 
    - What algorithms are involved in this innovation?

### Submission

- You’ll upload a digital archive of your finished artifact and documentation to Gradescope. 
    - The archive must be uploaded in a single upload for each file submission section. Multiple photo uploads will not be accepted. 
    - Multiple images or papers should be compressed and attached to your Artifact Documentation into a single file (PDF)
    - Exceptions are made for video or Snap! Files, which may be compressed into a single url link or .xml file and added as a link on the Documentation. Please remember to share access with all (public access), so we are able to grade your submission. Failure to do so will result in a ‘0’ score.
        - For video submissions we encourage attaching an unlisted YouTube Link or a Google Drive link
- Your Documentation should include:
    - The Title of your Artifact
    - Your Name
    - Date of submission 


## Part 2: Group Presentation + Peer Feedback

For this assignment, you will present your Artifact in small, collaborative groups during our scheduled Discussion session (Thursday 7-9 PM). This format is designed to foster a deeper exchange of ideas, encourage constructive feedback, and allow for a more intimate exploration of the societal, economic, or cultural impact of the tech-related topics we are studying.

The small group setting is intended to create a supportive environment where you can confidently showcase your creative medium, whether it be an artwork, sculpture, video, infographic, collage, or diorama. The goal of the presentations is not only to exhibit your work but to engage with your peers, offering insights into how your chosen medium effectively communicates the implications of your topic.

Presentations will be largely student led with AI/Tutor/TA supervision. You will be graded for your engagement and active participation. 

You will sign-up for a time and group (rec: 4-5) that best works for you. Sign ups are filled on a first-come first-serve basis. 

If you can not attend the allotted Discussion Time for any reason. You will have time in Makeup Office Hours to regain your points. Please, note we are only offering specific, limited times, and we will release more information later. Sign Ups will be released on Thursday, 10/17.

### Q&A Discussion Guidelines (3 minutes)

After your presentation, there will be a 3-5 minute discussion period where peers are encouraged to ask questions, share thoughts, and provide constructive feedback. This dialogue is essential for refining your understanding of both your own work and that of your peers.

Be ready to answer follow-up questions related to your project, process, and topic. This includes technical aspects, societal impacts, ethical considerations, and the use of AI tools. 

Aim to facilitate dialogue by asking the audience or classmates for their thoughts or feedback on your topic. You are in charge of the Q&A, so do your best to guide the conversation.

Conclude the Q&A with a brief summary of your project’s key points or takeaways based on the discussion. 

## Part 3: Peer Reflection/Comments
