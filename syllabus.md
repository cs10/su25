<!---- Added CS10 late? [Reading this](https://edstem.org/us/courses/63916/discussion/5218679)---->

## Preface

All times below are in PST. If you have any questions, please make an EdStem post (rather than emailing) or come to office hours.

## Welcome


Welcome to CS10: The Beauty and Joy of Computing! <br /><br />
We’re really excited to have you on board with us this semester for a gentle, but thorough introduction to Computer Science. Our course will start out in the block-based language Snap<em>!</em>, but will transition into Python once you've learned some fundamentals of programming. By the end of the course, we hope you'll walk away with a deeper understanding of the ideas that have come to define computer science, the ability to build your own programs, and the confidence to apply these skills in whichever field you choose to pursue.


## Platforms


This semester, CS10 will run fully in-person. Consequently, remote (or hybrid) students can not be supported. However, there are make-up options for lecture, lab, and discussion attendance. 


* **Course Website**: The day-to-day happenings of the course (and links to all the platforms below) can be found at cs10.org. Consult the [daily schedule](https://cs10.org/sp25/schedule/) to find the times/locations for all synchronous course engagements.
* **Edstem**: This will be our main Q&A platform, where you can ask (and answer) questions, see announcements, and read Weekly Blasts, which are required readings in CS10. Click the `Ed Discussion` tab on the left to navigate to Edstem. Here is the link to the [EdStem](https://edstem.org/us/courses/74174)
* **Gradescope**: This is where you will submit Projects 1-4, and the Final Project. Click the `Gradescope` tab on the left to open Edstem. Submission instructions can be found at the following: [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/957259).
* **Bcourses**: Lecture recordings can be found on [the Bcourses site](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1542284/external_tools/90481), generally within 48h of lecture. You will have to be logged into your Berkeley email to access the recordings. The recordings are under the "Media Gallery" tab in Bcourses.
* **IClicker**: You are required to [create a free iClicker account](https://mhe.my.site.com/iclicker/s/article/How-Students-Create-an-iClicker-Account-Through-a-Campus-Portal) and download the free iClicker app. Then, you should signup with your Berkeley email. To get credit for attending lecture, please open the app once you're seated in the lecture hall and mark your attendance. If for some reason you are not enrolled, use this the following links:
    -  [Lecture iClcker](https://join.iclicker.com/NATV).
    -  [Discussion iClicker](https://join.iclicker.com/DSRE)
    -  [Lab iClicker](https://join.iclicker.com/TOXH)
* **PrairieLearn**: This is the platform you will use to take exams (Quest, Midterm, and Postterm)
* **Snap!**: The programming language we will be using for more than half the semester. The website can be found here: [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu/)
* **Gradeview**: This is the website where you will be able to access your current grades in the class. You will need to sign-in using your UC Berkeley credentials on the [Gradeview](https://gradeview.eecs.berkeley.edu/login) website.


## Primary Course Components


### Lecture 

Lectures will be live and in-person in Anthropology and Art Practice Building, Room 160 Mondays and Wednesdays, from 1PM to 2PM. They will be recorded, and recordings will be posted on Bcourses (see `platforms` section). 

Lectures aim to introduce concepts and provide a "big-picture view" of material from a theoretical standpoint. Most lectures will be live and in person. However, some lectures may be pre-recorded, which you can watch on your free time, and there will be an assignment that corresponds to it to test your conceptual understanding. Attendance for these days will be through the "Lecture Quiz" solely (and no iClicker is needed for those days).

<b>Attendance is required, and credit for attending will be through the iClicker app. </b> If you cannot attend lecture, you will need to complete the corresponding "Lecture Quiz" on Gradescope for attendance credit. The corresponding lecture quiz will be due on Gradescope the day of the **following lecture** at 2359hrs. On this quiz, we will ask questions about lecture content. You may fill out our general extension form (linked below) to receive an automatic extension for lecture quizzes.

Your lowest 5 lecture-quiz scores will be automatically dropped — so you can miss up to 5 lectures (or skip 5 quizzes) without penalty, and you don’t need to inform us when you miss class. These drops are not intended to be “free-passes” to skip lectures: please reserve them for unexpected emergencies / sickness / … since missing out on content will only disrupt your learning. If there are extenuating circumstances which cause you to miss more than 5 lectures (like prolonged sickness, family emergencies, etc.) then you should visit Support OH.

Only Monday and Wednesday lectures have required attendance. Friday lectures will be optional and will have no lecture quiz. Some Friday lecture will be review where we prep for exams or go over the answers to an exam. The exam review Friday lectures will not be recorded and will not have any slides.

### Lab Sections

Labs will be held synchronously and are the primary place you will learn to program. Note that you are **strongly recommended** to complete all labs with a partner, and that partner-matching threads have been added to our Edstem Forum. On the first day of lab, Teaching Assistants (TAs) will help you find a partner in your assigned lab section. Labs will be located in Soda Hall, Room 438.

Lab assignments will be submitted to Gradescope. There will be two assignments for each lab (unless specified): one wherein you'll submit the code you wrote, and one with conceptual checkoff problems. If you get a full score on both Gradescope assignments, you will get credit for that lab. Labs are graded on an all-or-nothing basis, which means if you don't get a full score on either (or both) of the two assignments, then you won't get credit for that lab. In our lab sections, TAs and Tutors will be available to help you with the problems.

Lab X will be due the day that Lab X+1 is scheduled, at midnight. That is, each lab is due at midnight on the day that the next lab is released. For example, if Lab-12 is scheduled on Tuesday, and Lab-13 is scheduled on Thursday, then Lab-12 will be due at midnight on Thursday. There will be 19 graded labs (there's no submission or credit for lab-1 and this includes the two practice exams you must complete), and your lowest 2 lab scores will be dropped.

<b>Attendance to lab sections are required and part of your grade.</b> You can miss up to 5 lab sections without penalty so you do not need to inform us when you cannot attend lab. If there are extenuating circumstances which cause you to miss more than 5 lab sections (like prolonged sickness, family emergencies, etc.) then you should visit Support OH. Please note, the 5 "skip days" for lab sections only applies to attendance. You are still required to complete and submit the lab assignment. Lab attendance will be tracked through iClicker. 

If you cannot attend a lab section, then the lab will be due before the start of the next lab. So if you either cannot reguarly attend lab, or if you miss a day, the lab will be due earlier. For example, if Lab X is due on Tuesday at 11:59PM, but you did not attend lab in-person; then, the deadline for you to submit Lab X is Tuesday at 3PM (the time before the lab section).


### Discussion Sections

Discussion sections are where you will delve into the content more deeply with worksheets in traditional “pen-and-paper” style. This is where you will develop the theoretical computational skills needed to understand the basics of programming and to prepare for our exams. Discussion will be located in Evans Hall, Room 60. 

Discussion attendance is mandatory. If you attend, then we will check you off in person, and there is no further action needed to receive credit other than your participation during discussion. If you do not attend (either you have a regular conflict or just miss a few classes), then you can make-up the entire attendance credit by submitting the discussion worksheet (just the required portions) to Gradescope. You must complete the entire required portions of the worksheet to receive credit. Worksheets will be graded on completion and honest effort. Discussions will also be recorded, so we recommend watching the recordings to get help with the worksheet problems. 

The discussion worksheets are located on the website, and you will submit them to Gradescope. You can submit the worksheet in any format, i.e. handwritten, electronically written, typed, etc. Discussion worksheets are due the day of the next discussion section at 11:59 PM. So, if Discussion X is due when Discussion X + 1 is released.

Your 3 lowest discussion worksheet scores / misses will be dropped. This means you can not submit two worksheets and still get full credit in your discussion grade. Please reserve these drops for unexpected emergencies / sickness / etc. You do not need to contact us if you miss or do not attend discussion. If you need an extension, please see the extension request section. 

From experience, we've observed that students who regularly attend and pay attention in discussions tend to do better on exams.

### Office Hours (OH) 

There will be three kinds of OH, described bellow. The times and locations for all OH are all posted under the 'daily schedule' tab on the course website. You <b>don't</b> need to email / obtain an appointment. You can attend any and all OH that work for you (i.e. you don't just have to attend your TA's OH.)


#### General OH

General OH is intended for any course and content related questions. Here, you can get help with your code, debugging, understanding something conceptually, getting started on assignments, etc. General OH will be located in Soda-326

#### Support OH 

These are intended for students to discuss their status in their class, catching up, discussing extenuating circumstances, requesting extensions, getting additional support, etc. Support OH is NOT for content related questions. So if you have questions about content, we will redirect you to General OH or Instructor OH

#### Instructor OH 

Professor Garcia will be hosting Instructor OH (3 to 4PM on Wednesdays), which you may attend for more conceptual help (for instance, if you're confused about some topic, or want to go over practice problems) or to discuss more general topics (e.g. college advice or how you're doing in the class.) For help with specific assignments (labs and projects), you should attend Staff-OH.


### Reading Quizzes

These are short assigned readings each week. We will discuss them as a class during discussion section. They are required reading, and you will answer the questions on the discussion worksheets pertaining to the readings.

### Projects 

These assignments will be one of the best ways for you to apply what you have learned in lecture, lab, and discussion. These will be a bit more time intensive than the other assignments and will require you to be caught up on the other components of the course.


- There will be 3 Snap<em>!</em> projects, 1 research-based project, and 1 project wherein you can use a language of your choice to build something of your choice. The number of points per project is listed in the Grading Breakdown. Project specs will be released on the website and on Edstem, and you should always read them before starting to work on a project.

## Projects and Deadlines


| Project                                       |  Submission Deadline     |
| :----:                                        |  :----:                  |
| Project 1: Wordle™-lite                       | Wed 2/05  |
| Project 2: Spelling-Bee                       | Mon 2/24  |
| Project 3: 2048                               | Mon 3/17 |
| Project 4: Explore Post                       | Mon 3/31 |
| Project 4: Explore Post Feedback + Comments   | Fri 4/11 |
| Project 5: Final Project Porposals            | Mon 4/07  |
| Project 5: Final Project                      | Mon 5/05  |

**All deadlines are at 11:59PM.**

* **Project Parties**: These will serve as specialized OH wherein you'll be able to work with your peers <b>(within the limits of our collaboration policies)</b> and seek assistance from course-staff on whatever project is currently assigned. We strongly encourage you to attend project parties as they will help you finish your assignments on time. Project Parties will typically take place during scheduled Lab Times or special Office Hours. Dates and locations will be listed on the daily schedule and announced in the weekly blast.

## Exams

There will be three take-home, untimed, online, 48-hour, open-note exams (Quest, Midterm, and Postterm):
- Quest
- Midterm
- Postterm (final)

Here are the specific dates for exams, although these dates may change. All exams will be released at 6PM on Fridays.

| Exam             | Release  | Due         |   
| :----:           | :----:   | :----:      | 
| Quest 1          | Fri 2/14 | Sun 2/16    |  
| Quest 2          | Fri 2/21 | Sun 2/23    |
| Quest 3          | Fri 2/28 | Sun 3/02    |  
| Midterm 1        | Fri 3/14 | Sun 3/16    |  
| Midterm 2        | Fri 3/21 | Sun 3/23    |  
| Midterm 3        | Fri 4/04 | Sun 4/06    | 
| Postterm 1       | Fri 4/18 | Sun 4/20    |  
| Postterm 2       | Fri 4/25 | Sun 4/27    |  
| Postterm 3       | Fri 5/02 | Sun 5/04    |  

You will see various exams (for example, Quest 1, 2 3, etc.) Each exam type (Quest, Midterm, Postterm) has three exams. The purpose of this is to allow you to retake the exam (it will be a simliar but different exam each time), and earn credit on questions you missed in the previous exam. Quest 1, Midterm 1, and Postterm 1 are all mandatory; however, each retake is optional.

Note that on a retake exam, you only need to re-do the problems you did not receive full credit on. For instance, suppose you got full credit on Question-3 but lost points on Question-5, you could only redo Question-5. 

Moreover, we will keep your question-wise maximum score between the original Quest and the retake, for each problem. For instance, suppose you re-took question 5 but scored lesser points, we'll just keep your score from the original Quest instead!

The best way to prepare is to utilize the practice exams posted under `resources` and the practice exams we'll release on PrairieLearn. 

If you are an incomplete student, remember that you can only take the first exams (Quest 1, Midterm 1, and Postterm 1).

## Exam Clobber Policy
If your percentage score on a latter exam is higher than your percentage score on a prior exam, then we'll replace your percentage score on the prior exam with the percentage score on the latter exam. The clobber can never hurt your grade: if you score lower, no replacement will be done.

Your total points will be rounded to the nearest integer when we compute letter grades. 0.5 will round to 1, but 0.49 will round to 0. We will not shift the bins / curve the class / ooch or round your grade beyond the listed rounding scheme, so please don't ask.


## Extension Requests

For all extension requests on any assignment, please use the [Extension Request Form](https://forms.gle/FaAosSEWXKGWoXoV9).

You're also allowed to retroactively obtain extensions without penalty: i.e., you can obtain an extension even after the deadline of a lab/project, but not after the extended deadline for that assignment. The extended deadline for labs, as noted above, is the day that the next lab is scheduled, at 2359 hrs; for projects, it's 72h after the original deadline.


<b>NOTE: If you added the course late, please use your updated deadline as the 'original due date'.</b>

<b>Important: While extensions may not be visible on PrairieLearn/Gradescope (a.k.a your assignments may be marked as 'Late'), they will be factored in when we compute your final grade. Extensions are AUTO-approved after filling in the form. You may immediately continue/start on the assignment. </b>

### Lab Extensions

We understand that circumstances may arise that may cause you to not be able to meet assignment deadlines.<br /><br />The policy for extension requests on labs are as follows:

- An extension request will grant you an extra lab section in order to complete the lab assignment without any lateness penalties. For instance, if you ask for an extension on lab-12, which is generally due on the day that lab-13 is scheduled, then it will now be due the day that lab-14 is scheduled. So, if you are getting an exttension on Lab X, then the new deadline for Lab X is when Lab X + 2 is released at 11:59PM. However, if you are trying to obtain lab attendance credit, then it is due by 5PM when Lab X + 2 is released.

- There are three exceptions:
    - The last lab will only be given a 72-hour extension.
    - Practice Midterm will only be given a 48-hour extension (for both the coding and non-coding)
    - Practice Postterm will only be given a 48-hour extension (for both the coding and non-coding)


### Project Extensions

The policy for project extension requests on projects are as follows:

- An extension request will automatically extend your project submission deadline by 72 hours without any lateness penalties. For instance, if a project is due by Monday at midnight, then the project will now be due by Thursday at midnight.

### Lecture Quiz Extensions

- An extension request will automatically extend your lecture quiz submission deadline and will be due the day of the following lecture at 11:59PM. For example, if the lecture quiz was due on Monday, with the extension, it is now due on Wednesday. Similar to the Lab extension and deadline policy, the Lecture Quiz, with the extension is due when Lecture Quiz X + 2 is released.


### Discussion Worksheet Extensions

- An extension request will automatically extend your discussion worksheetsubmission deadline and will be due the day of following discussion section at 11:59PM. For example, if the worksheet was due on 1/30, it is now due on 2/06. 


## Lateness Penalties

Any labs or projects that are submitted late will receive half-credit, regardless of how late the submission is. For the project-4 and the final project, late submissions may not be graded since our grading staff has limited availability. If you need an extension, please utilize the extension request forms. No extensions are provided for Reading Quizzes, and late submissions are not graded.

If, after exhausting the initial extension, you still need more time — please visit us in Support-OH, wherein we'll help you come up with a plan to catch up! Lateness penalties *only* apply if you *don't* obtain an extension (by filling out the form or visiting Support-OH) *and* turn in work late. 

## DSP Accommodations

If you have a DSP accommodation through the university, please be sure to submit your official letter through the DSP portal. Once you have done so, we will be able to accommodate you. If you have an accommodation but are unable to promptly submit the letter for whatever reason, please reach out to Victoria [jedi_force@](mailto:jedi_force@berkeley.edu).

UC Berkeley is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the needs of its diverse student body including students with disabilities. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please feel welcome to discuss your concerns with me.

If you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, you can work with the Disabled Students' Program (DSP) to request an official accommodation. The Disabled Students' Program (DSP) is the campus office responsible for authorizing disability-related academic accommodations, in cooperation with the students themselves and their instructors. You can find more information about DSP, including contact information and the application process here: dsp.berkeley.edu. If you have already been approved for accommodations through DSP, please meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together."

Students who need academic accommodations or have questions about their accommodations should contact DSP, located at 260 César Chávez Student Center. Students may call 642-0518 (voice), 642-6376 (TTY), or e-mail dsp@berkeley.edu(link sends e-mail)

## Academic Integrity

Let’s get honest about being honest. It is truly a disappointment to catch students cheating. All we really want is for you to learn the material- and as both current and former students, we understand that oftentimes, juggling various assignment deadlines while keeping up with material can be stressful. If you feel overwhelmed in this class, reach out! We are here to support you.

Here, we will lay out our academic integrity policies which can help you distinguish between cheating (prohibited) and collaboration (encouraged.)

### Generative AI Policy

In this course, generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot) are permitted solely as aids for enhancing your understanding of challenging concepts, but should not be used to produce answers, generate code, or verify solutions. Generative AI may only support conceptual growth, helping you explore topics that need further clarification.

Misuse of generative AI to obtain answers or complete assignments violates academic integrity and course standards, as all submitted work must reflect your own understanding and effort. This policy ensures AI serves as a tool for your learning without compromising the integrity of the course objectives and assessments.


**What constitutes cheating?**

* Copying part or all of another student’s project code with the exception of your partner(s) assuming that the project you are working on allows for partnered work. This includes students from previous semesters (we still have their code and will know if you do this).
* Sharing or receiving the exact steps used to solve a project problem (even if code is not explicitly sent).
* Copying part or all of another student’s exam answers.
* Collaborating with another student when taking exams by receiving or giving assistance of any kind.
* Copying code from online sources.


**What constitutes collaboration?**

* **Asking instead of telling**. If you’re working with your friends and one of them is stuck on a part of an assignment, try to ask them guiding questions instead of telling them the answer.
* **Keeping things conceptual!** It’s more beneficial to your learning if you come up with a solution yourself, rather than having it told to you. This also applies if you are helping someone else.
We highly encourage collaboration, so let’s define what that means. Discussing approaches to problems is fine (in fact, we actively encourage it), as long as you eventually arrive at a good enough understanding of the problem that you are able to code the solution completely by yourself. You should not allow concerns about cheating to get in the way of discussing the class material with your classmates. It is okay if you have received some help with ideas along the way (but not a fully worked out solution).\*

\*This policy was adapted from Professor Alistair Sinclair’s policy for CS 172.


**What happens if you cheat?**

We take cheating extremely seriously, and will almost always pursue the strictest consequences available to us. We have advanced cheating detection software, and will routinely run this to detect cheating. These are sophisticated tools that are pretty hard to fool- any attempts to obfuscate your code to avoid detection will likely fail, and instead may result in additional consequences.

Note that you will always have a chance to explain your actions before any action is taken. If you admit that you cheated, we will apply the necessary sanctions. If you'd like to meet with us to discuss your situation, we'll set up a meeting. Afterwards, if staff determines that you cheated and you don't agree with that decision, we'll proceed with a Student-Conduct Investigation.

**What are the sanctions?**

On projects / other assignments, the minimum penalty is negative points on that assignment alongside a referral to the Office of Student Conduct. For repeated / more egregious offences, we may grant a failing grade in the class.

On exams, we will be absolutely unforgiving. Any instance of cheating results in an immediate F in the class alongside a referral to the Office of Student Conduct.

If at any point in the academic-integrity process, a student lies or attempts to mislead course-staff  —thereby wasting everyone’s time— then in addition to the aforementioned sanctions, the s will write a recommendation for the student’s dismissal and submit it to the Office of Student Conduct.



## Diversity and Inclusion Statement

We recognize that Computer Science is a demographically skewed field in the United States, and that even at Berkeley, minoritized students can find themselves feeling alone. It is our goal in this course to deliver an equitable learning experience for everyone involved. Concretely, this means a few things:
- In addition to teaching the technical skills necessary for programming, we will also teach the social implications of computer science. In doing so, we will directly address the contributions of underrepresented groups to the field, which are often overlooked.
- We will do our absolute best to show you that while bias, discrimination, and judgment still exist, they should not stand in the way of you learning Computer Science. While acknowledging the struggles many students may face, we also hope to show that computer science is a field anyone can be successful in (in other words, there is no innate "talent" or "trait" required to understand computer science). Of course, different people have different opportunities, but one of the goals of CS10 is to equalize the playing field.
- Discrimination or disrespect on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status, ability, gender, or sexual orientation will not be tolerated under any circumstances. Should someone make you feel uncomfortable or disrespected in any way, please let the instructor know immediately.

## EECS Student Climate & Incident Reporting Form

It is very important to the EECS Department that every student in the EECS community feels safe, respected and welcome.  We recognize though that incidents happen, sometimes unintentionally, that run counter to that goal.
The EECS department provides a secure and anonymous [Incident Reporting Form](https://eecs.link/climate) that can be used to report incidents including (but not limited to) microaggressions, discrimination, marginalizing / alienating behaviour, etc.
